// Two-steps decomposition heuristic + exact warm start.
// Port of Old_Project/src/twoStepsSolver.*:
//   per product l: solve stage 2 (warehouses->customers) as a 1-stage FLP; the flow
//   leaving each warehouse becomes the demand of stage 1 (factories->warehouses);
//   union of opened facilities across products -> route all products (min-cost flow)
//   -> close unused facilities -> heuristic solution = MIP start + cutoff for the exact model.
